PROJECT 2 - System's Programming

Bashscript runs like this: ./create_infiles.sh inputFile input_dir numFilesPerDirectory
-Firstly it checks if the number given is correct. 
-It creates a folder with name input_dir. If the folder already exists, then it prints an error message and it exits. 
-For every different country found in inputFile, it creates a subdirectory in input_dir, with the country's name.
- In each subdirectory it creates n files (n = numFilesPerDirectory), in the format of 'country-n.txt'. 
-While reading inputFile, it will locate all the lines that refer to the certain country, and will copy them to the aforementioned files, 
using round-robin.
